		<h2>How did Dynasty 11 Studios get its start?</h2>
		<p>I initially formed Dynasty 11 Studios to develop a science fiction series that I designed,
			codename: Project Stargazer - our next project. As I came to understand the totality of what it would
			take to develop this series, I realized that for the sustainability and stability of the studio, I needed to
			create something else first that would be both more feasible to develop and would lay the financial
			foundation for the studio. Enter: Player 2.</p>
		<h2>What prompted the creation of Player 2?</h2>
		<p>There were two primary motivators. First, at the time, I was playing a lot of Destiny, Battlefield, and
			Halo, and was having terrible experiences with match-made teammates, which really put a damper on
			my gaming experience. I then kept seeing countless people sharing the same frustration on social media.
			The more I considered how to address this problem, the more I thought of ways to bring gamers
			together beyond what already existed on streaming platforms, social media, or existing in-game
			matchmaking. Those solutions became Player 2 - the Gamer’s Companion.
			Secondly, from a business perspective, I wanted to introduce Dynasty 11 Studios publicly as a
			company that brings more to the table than a good idea - we care about making the gaming experience
			more enjoyable. Player 2 is first and foremost a service created by gamers, for gamers. We strive to
			support the success of everything gaming, from AAA and Indie dev studios alike, to content creators,
			gaming communities, and everyday gamers of all types.</p>
		<h2>What do you do at Dynasty 11 Studios?</h2>
		<p>In a sentence, I do whatever I can to ensure that the members of my studio are empowered to
			do their best work. As CEO, I oversee the strategy, finance, and operation of the business. This side of
			my job is all about the “Mamba Mentality” - I relentlessly look for ways to improve myself and my
			contribution to the company. As Creative Director, I have the privilege of collaborating with some
			immensely talented and intelligent people, whether that’s whipping up our daily social media content,
			combing through every last detail of Player 2’s design, or conceiving the Dynasty 11 Studios logo with
			colored pencils! (include D11 logo)</p>
		<h2>What’s a fun fact about you?</h2>
		<p>I love orchestral soundtrack music - nothing helps more to harness my creative and critical thinking.
			Here are some of my favorites:
			Music for focusing:
			1. Bear McCreary - Battlestar Galactica
			2. David Arnold - James Bond, Independence Day, & Stargate
			3. Blake Neely - DC/CW “Arrowverse” shows
			4. Ron Jones, Dennis McCarthy, Jay Chattaway et al. - Star Trek: The Next Generation, Deep
			Space Nine, Voyager, and Enterprise
			Music for creative thinking:
			1. John Williams - Where do I begin with this legend? Star Wars? Harry Potter? Jurassic Park?
			Superman? His Olympic works?
			2. Michael Giacchino - The heir to the John Williams throne, especially with Rogue One: A Star
			Wars Story
			3. Marty O’Donnell & Michael Salvatori - Halo CE, 2, 3, ODST, & Reach
			4. Michael Salvatori et al. – Destiny and Destiny 2</p>
		<h2>Bonus Favorite:</h2>
		<p>D11’s very own Brian Sanyshyn. We’ve been working for some time on the Project
			Stargazer soundtrack, and it’s a shame to have to keep the extent of how brilliant a composer he is
			under wraps – for now. You can all enjoy a taste of his work on our Tuesday “Guess that Game Theme”
			content, and on our website at dynasty11.com.
			Any closing words of advice?
			I am a huge fan of science fiction, and in particular Star Trek, so I’ll invoke the words of Star Trek
			creator Gene Roddenberry, “. . . Humanity will reach maturity and wisdom on the day that it begins not
			just to tolerate, but to take special delight in differences in ideas and differences in life . . .” These
			words
			inform how we approach our creative process at Dynasty 11 Studios, as well as how I approach my life.</p>
